# Engineering 4 Notebook 
 All of Jasper and Jack's Engineering 4 assignments!

## Hello Raspberry Pi Zero 
| Assignment  |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: During this assignment we learned the basics of using and setting up a Raspberry Pi Zero. We were also introduced to using some simple terminal commands to navigate and create folders and files. Use arrow keys for shortcuts.
Code: [Hello Raspberry](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Flask/hello_world/app.py) |

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Hello Mathmatica
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: This assignment taught us how to use Mathmatica to calculate and graph equations. Along with this we learned how to make lists, which are one of the most powerful things you can do in Mathmatica. 
Code: [Hello Mathmatica](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Mathematica_Plot.nb) |

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Hello Python
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: This assignment taught us the basics of using the programming language, Python that comes installed on the Raspberry Pi Zero. Always push your python assignments to github.
Code: [Hello Python](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/lesson00.py) |

&nbsp;

## Python Program 01 – Calculator
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: In this assignment, we learned how to use Python to calculate equations. Use these four lines 
print("Sum:\t\t" + doMath(a,b))
print("Difference:\t" + doMath(a,b,2))
print("Product:\t" + doMath(a,b,3))
print("Quotient:\t" + doMath(a,b,4))
print("Modulo:\t\t" + doMath(a,b,5))
at the end of your code to help.
Code: [Calculator](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/calculator.py) |

&nbsp;
## Python Program 02 – Quadratic Solver
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: We learned how to make our Pi solve more complex equations as we had it solve the quadratic equation with changing variables. Just ask your teacher about arrays.
Code: [Quadratic Solver](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/quadraticsolver.py) |

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Python Program 03 – Strings and Loops
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: This assignment taught us how to split sentences using the split function in Python. We also were introduced to the process of committing and pushing our work to Github.
Code: [Strings & Loops]( https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/stringsandloops.py) |

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Python Challenge – MSP
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: During this assignment we learned how important it is to take the time to test the code in chunks. This allowed us to find errors easier and fix them in order to move on the next part.
Code: [Hangman](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/hangman.py) |

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## GPIO Pins – Bash
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: During this assignment we learned how to write a bash script for the Raspberry Pi. We took what we used to do on arduinos and used it for the Raspberry Pi.
Code: [Bash GPIO](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Scripts/bash_gpio.sh) |

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## GPIO Pins - Python
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: In this assignment we learned how to combine our bash experience and python experience to make LED's blink.
Code: [Python GPIO](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/gpiopins.py) |

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## GPIO Pins - Flask
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: This assignment taught us about the internet abilities the Pi possesses. We learned how to connect to the Pi from another device and control the LED's.
First Code: [App.py](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Flask/gpio/app.py)
Second Code: [Index](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Flask/gpio/templates/index.html) |

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## GPIO Pins - I2C
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: In this assignment we learned how to take what we learned from the last assignment and create an actual web server that can be accessed from any device with internet access. From this server we were able to control the LED's with buttons.
Code: [I2C GPIO](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/i2c.py) |

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Headless
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: This assigment we had to run our program without a monitor, keyboard, or mouse, so we had to have the code run on startup. We got a little caught up trying different codes to make it run on startup but after trial and error, we were able to figure it out. Use Bashrc on this weabsite [Run On Startup](https://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/run-a-program-on-your-raspberry-pi-at-startup/)
Code: [Headless](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Headless.py) |

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Pi Camera
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: For the assignment we had to work with a little camera that wires up to the pi. We learned about making the camera window smaller because when it was full screen we were unable to exit out of the window.
First Test Code: [Test01](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/camera_test01.py)
Second Test Code: [Test02](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/camera_test02.py) 
Third Test Code: [Test03](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/camera_test03.py) |

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Hack Your Stuff
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: During this assignment we learned about using alarms. We had to figure out how to activate it with a button instead of a switch.
Code: [Alarm](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Beeper.py) |

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Copypasta
| Assignment |
| ----- |
| Lesson Learned: For this assignment we had to learn how to use a parent detector to take pictures on the camera, and then also make a stop motion with images captured on the pi camera. We had to make the camera take each picture for the stop motion animation whenever a button was pressed.
Part One Code: [Security Cam](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/parent-detector.py) 
Part Two Code: [Stop Motion](https://github.com/jasacrum/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/stopanimation.py) |
